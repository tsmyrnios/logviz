#logviz

An HTML5-based log visualizer.

###Overview

This tool allows you to load log files of a variant of JSON format (format allows one JSON object per line in the file) and view the results plotted out in an animated way as the data from the file is asynchronously loaded. The tool allows for the loading of a header file, which can be used to initialize the plot graph bounds without having to read through the whole log file (useful in the cases of large log files).

###Basic Instructions

1. Click *Load Files*
2. Click *Choose File* and browse to select the file (repeat this for both the header and detail files).
3. Click the *Load* button
3. Multi-select the desired *Plot Data Fields*
4. You can choose to initialize the X and Y axes by clicking *set from selected field data* next to *View Range* or skip this step and enter in the ranges manually.
5. The X and Y axes can be further adjusted if you need to adjust the graph to hone in more granularly.
6. Click the *Start* button

###Browser Compatibility

Supported in all modern browsers which support HTML5 Canvas and FileReader.

###Future

This tool is rough for now, but may see the following future mods:

- add support for CSV
- add support for W3C log format
- make it prettier
- make it appear like you are on a movie "hacking into the mainframe" when using this tool :)
