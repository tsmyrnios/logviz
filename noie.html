        <p>Unfortunately, your version of IE was not made to support the HTML5 features used by this app.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for you, FireFox, Chrome, and Safari have supported these advanced features for a while, so you can use those browsers
            or update your IE version to 9 or above.</p>
